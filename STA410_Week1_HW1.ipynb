    "Recursive functions can be very powerful when used in *divide and conquer* algorithms, but without [tail recursion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33923/what-is-tail-recursion) (via automated compiler optimization) recursive implementations they entails the overhead of retaining the state of function calls on the \"stack\" until they complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the recursive implementation of $u_k = au_{k-1} \\text{ mod } m$ below, `f(a, m, n, x)` may not be \"popped\" from the \"stack\" until `[x] + f(a, m, n-1, x)` completes, which means `f(a, m, n, x)` can't be removed from memory until `f(a, m, n-1, x)` is removed from memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def f(a, m, n, s):\n",
    "    if n is 0:\n",
    "        return []\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        x = a*s % m\n",
    "        return [x] + f(a, m, n-1, x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this recursion is in fact fully sequential it provides no *divide and conquer* affect(!); thus, despite the natural recusive specification of this problem the recursive implementation unnecessarily requries more computational resources without providing any recursive divide and conquer benefit compared with a direct iterative \"for loop\" implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> To confirm that your implementation is indeed recursive, the autotest will check for a  `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison` runtime error. Therefore do not increase the allowable maximum recursion stack depth. Anyway, such a change would in this case mask the unnecessarily wasteful computational overhead of storing function state spaces on the \"stack\" while waiting for the nested functions to complete, so it would be a very bad idea in this case...\n",
