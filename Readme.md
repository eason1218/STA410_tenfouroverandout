Fri: *one*-hour lecture and *two*-hour coding challenge

## Topics

Jan 06-10: Pseudorandom numbers [AKA various excuses to gain coding comfort and consider computers]  
Jan 13-17: Sampling methods [AKA now we're REALLY doing some computation: pre-material supports CC]  
Jan 20-24: Variance reduction methods [AKA slamming breaks after CC2 where it SHOULD be getting fun]  
Jan 27-31: Markov chain methods (which are just more efforts towards Monte Carlo integration...)  
Feb 03-07: Numeric precision  
Feb 10-14: Direct methods  
Feb 17-21: READING WEEK  
Feb 24-28: Functional bases  
Mar 03-07: Iterative methods  
Mar 10-14: Variance reduction (and ML)  
Mar 17-21: Newton-like methods  
Mar 24-28: Bayesian deep learning  
Apr -1-04: Generative modeling  


## Projects

Package me up some nice functionality that you've put together from the course.  
Impress me with your Python package and it's presentation on github.
