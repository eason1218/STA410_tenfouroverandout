# STA410H1S (W25): Statistical Computation / STA2102H1S Computational Techniques in Statistics

Friday 12-3 PM AH 400

## Grading

MarkUs HWs: 40=4\*10 best  
MarkUs CCs: 40=4\*10 best  
Course Project: 20  

## Schedule

Mon-Thur: *three*-hour homework and *two*-hour pre-lectur reading assignment  
Fri: *one*-hour lecture and *two*-hour coding challenge

## Topics

Jan 06-10: Pseudorandom numbers [AKA various excuses to gain coding comfort and consider computers]  
Jan 13-17: Sampling methods [AKA now we're REALLY doing some computation: pre-material supports CC]  
Jan 20-24: Variance reduction methods [AKA slamming breaks after CC2 where it SHOULD be getting fun]  
Jan 27-31: Markov chain methods [AKA just more Monte Carlo integration but now how in high dimensions]  
Feb 03-07: Numeric precision [AKA more sequential stuff since computers are cumulative Markov Chains]  
Feb 10-14: Direct methods [AKA we know all the steps to get the answer and just need to execute them]  
Feb 17-21: READING WEEK  
Feb 24-28: Functional bases [AKA building on SVD (+PCA+PRC?) so hopefully this is making some sense]
- Bonus Points: some more direct "Matrix" struff (which I think I'll be able to make available "soon")  
- Bonus Points: some more bases stuff with FFT (which I think I'll be able to make available "soon")  

Mar 03-07: More iterative methods and variance reduction redux from the perspective of ML
Mar 10-14: Gradient methods
Mar 17-21: Newton-like methods  
Mar 24-28: Bayesian deep learning  
Apr -1-04: Generative modeling  


## Projects

Package me up some nice functionality that you've put together from the course.  
Impress me with your Python package and it's presentation on github.
